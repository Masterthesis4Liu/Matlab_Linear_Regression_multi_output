# Matlab_Linear_Regression_multi_output

in the repository Matlab_Linear_Regression i use the absolute maximun as single output.

but in fact the maximum shear angle and the minimum shear angel all of them are important.

because the plus or minus represebtative only direction of the shear angle.

so we take both of them as multi-output [max_shear_angle, min_shear_angle].

after the same step, we can see that the results are much much better than before.
